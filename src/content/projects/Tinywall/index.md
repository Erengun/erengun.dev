• Contributed to the development of Tinywall, a mobile app using Flutter, offering a user-friendly car parking solution. By implementing the MVVM structure and utilizing Mobx for state management and GetIt for dependency injection, I improved code organization by 30% and reduced bugs by 25%.

• Successfully published Tinywall on the Google Play Store, making it available to users worldwide.
